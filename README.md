## Fizzbuzz Technical Writing

### Process
- [x] Write a simple code example of FizzBuzz
- [x] Write a working, more complex code example of FizzBuzz
- [ ] Write a simplistic tutorial for exposure to Typescript concepts, using the simple example
- [ ] Go into more intermediate examples with a tutorial on the extendible complex code
- [ ] Look at the TypeScript handbook to see if we can make more contrived examples for further exposure/demo

### Article Technology

- [x] Choose technologies to build the page (React? Next? Something else?)
  - Next.js on portfolio
- [ ] Mock up an article page with CSS
- [ ] Think about splitting the text out of the page itself.
- [x] Find a way to present and run code
  - react-live-editor
- [ ] Find which concepts are "diagrammable" or can be represented visually. Use Excalidraw for that.
